on the web (user-generated content), crawled from the Buscape's 
website. The mispellings are classified in 4 classes:

 1. **Typo** (1,027 tokens): mispellings related to typographical problems, 
    usually related to key adjacency or fast keystroking.
 2. **Phono** (732 tokens: 683 not contextual and 49 contextual): cognitive 
    mispellings, which are the produced by a lack of understanding of 
    letter-to-sound correspondences in written language. Contextual 
    phonological errors are mispellings which generate a character 
    sequence that corresponds to another existing word in the dictionary 
    such as: "eu vou compra" / "eu vou comprar".
 3. **Diac** (2,037 tokens: 1,625 not contextual and 412 contextual):
    this class identifies misspellings which are related to the inserting,
    removing or replacing diacritics from a given word, e.g. "organizacao" /
    "organização".
 4. **Int_slang** (201 tokens): use of internet slang.
 5. **Other** (86 tokens): other types of errors/ spurious ortography that 
    do not belong to any of the above classes, such as abbreviations, 
    loanwords, proper nouns, technical jargon, etc.
